Machine learning 🤖 is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data to make predictions or decisions. Instead of following explicit rules (like a traditional program), these systems identify patterns within vast amounts of information.To build your introductory text for machine learning, we can explore these three core areas. I'll ask guiding questions along the way to help you fill in the details:

The Three Main Types: Understanding supervised learning (learning with labels), unsupervised learning (finding hidden patterns), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).

The Training Process: How we take raw data, split it into training and testing sets, and help the model "learn" from its mistakes.

Real-World Applications: Exploring how machine learning powers things you use every day, like recommendation engines, spam filters, or image recognition.
