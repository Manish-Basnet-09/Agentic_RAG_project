Introduction \\nV oting is the backbone of any democracy, but the way we do it hasn’t changed  much in \\ndecades. We still mostly rely on paper ballots, which are slow to count, expensive to \\nmanage, and sometimes just hard to access for people who can’t easily get to a polling \\nstation. As everything else, from banking to education moves online, it’s natural that our \\nvoting system should too. \\nElectronic voting (e-voting) isn’t just about making things “faster”. It’s about making the \\nprocess more inclusive for everyone, including those in remote areas, people with \\ndisabilities, and people residing abroad. However, moving the ballot box to the internet \\ncomes with the huge problem: trust. If people can’t see their physical paper going in a box, \\nthey often worry about whether their vote was counted or if the system was hacked.  \\nOur project explores how we can build a digital voting system that people can trust. Instead \\nof just making a basic website click a button, this project focuses on “Secure -by-Design\" \\nprinciples. The goal is to create a platform where a voter identity stays private, but the result \\nremains 100% transparent and tamper -proof. By combining modern web security with \\nintelligent data auditing, the system aims to show that we can have a digital democracy that \\nis both convenient and more secure than traditional paper methods. \\n2. Problem Statement \\nThe existing manual voting system suffers from several limitations such as delayed results \\nof publication, high administrative cost, chances of invalid votes, lack of accessibility for \\nremote voters, and vulnerability to human error and manipulation. Managing large -scale \\nelections using conventional methods is inefficient and resource intensive. Therefore, there \\nis a need for a secure, reliable, and efficient electronic voting system that can overcome \\nthese issues while maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the voting process. \\n3. Objectives \\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop a functional and reliable e-voting system that \\nbridges the gap between digital convenience and electoral security. The specific objectives \\nare as follows:'),\n",

Methodology \\nThis project follows a structured engineering approach to ensure that the final system is \\nboth secure and reliable. We aren’t building a website; we are designing a secure \\nenvironment where data integrity is the top priority. The methodology is divided int o \\nseveral stages, from identifying what the system needs to be designed for  the actual \\narchitecture. \\n4.1. Requirement Identification \\nBefore writing any code, we need to clearly define the rules and tools for the system. This \\ninvolves looking at how things are done now and what we need to change. \\n4.1.1. Study of Existing System \\nThe existing voting system is largely manual, involving physical polling stations, ballot \\npapers, and manual counting. This system is time -consuming, costly, and prone to errors \\nsuch as ballot mishandling, miscounting, and vote duplication. Security and tr ansparency \\nissues further reduce public trust in the process. \\n4.1.2. Literature Review \\nThe shift toward digital democracy has been  a major research topic for over two decades, \\nbut the focuses has recently moved just “counting votes’ to ensuring “End -to-End \\nVerifiability.” Early systems, like the Estonian i-V oting model, proved that remote voting \\ncould increase turnout, but they were often criticized for having centralized vulnerabilities \\nwhere a single server breach could ruin an entire election  [4]. Recent studies suggest that  \\nthe only way to fix this is by combining strong cryptography with automated auditing so \\nthat no one person has total control over the results [4,6].'),\n",

By using a public key to lock \\nthe vote on the user device before it even reaches the database, the system ensures that even \\nif a hacker gets into the backend , they only see scrambled data rather than actual votes  \\n[1,5]. However, encryption alone doesn’t stop everything; it can ’t distinguish between a \\nreal voter and a bot. This is where the newest research in 2024 and 2025 comes in, \\nsuggesting that machine learning is the “missing piece’ of the puzzle for verifying identity \\nand detecting impersonation.[7] \\nMany recent papers have started exploring Anomaly Detection to solve the problem of \\nautomated fraud. Standard systems are reactive – they only find out they were hacked after \\nit’s over – but by using algorithms like Isolation Forest, a system can, learn what normal \\nvoting looks like and flag suspicious activity in real time  [2]. Furthermore , choosing \\nFastAPI for the backend is the strategic choice supported by 2025 performance \\nbenchmarks. Its asynchronous nature allows it to handle the high throughput required for \\nreal-time ML interface an d cryptographic tasks much more efficiently than older \\nsynchronous frameworks [3]. \\n4.1.3. Requirement Analysis \\nThis section defines exactly what the system needs to be    considered a success. We have \\nsplit these into functional and non-functional requirements, which are the specific features \\nand actions the system must perform, and non-functional requirements which describe the \\nquality and security standards the system must meet. \\n4.1.3.1. Functional Requirements \\nA. Voter Authentication and Eligibility: \\nThe system must verify a user with secure login credentials. It also need s to check the \\ncentral database to ensure they are eligible to vote in the current election. \\nB. Secure Ballot Casting: \\nOnce verified, the voter must be presented with a clear, unbiased digital ballot. The system \\nmust allow them to select their choice and confirm it before the final submission to prevent \\naccidental mistakes.'),\n",

One-Person, One-Vote: \\nThe system must strictly prevent double voting. Once a ballot is cast, the user ’s “eligible” \\nstatus must be immediately updated to “voted” across the entire database to block any \\nfurther attempts. \\nD. Automated Result Tabulation: \\nAfter the election period ends, the system should automatically and accurately count the \\nencrypted votes and generate a final tally without requiring manual human intervention , \\nwhich reduces risk or error. \\nE. Result generation and display: \\nThe system must process the final counts and instantly generate a summary of the results. \\nThis data needs to be displayed through a clear, public -facing dashboard using charts or \\ntables so that everyone (voters and admin alike) can see the final outcome in a transparent \\nand easy to understand way. \\n4.1.3.2. Non-Functional Requirements \\nNon-functional requirements are about the “experience” and the “integrity” of the system. \\nThese are the behind-the-scenes qualities that make the platform trustworthy and usable. \\nA. Security and Privacy: \\nThis is the most critical requirement. The system must use encryption to ensure that even \\nif someone accesses the database, they cannot link a specific vote back to a specific person’s \\nidentity. \\nB. System Integrity and Tamper Resistance: \\nThe backend must be “Secure by Design”, meaning the data cannot be modified or deleted \\nonce it is recorded. Every action should leave a permanent, unchangeable audit trail. \\nC. Reliability and Availability: \\nSince election happens in a specific window of time, the system must stay online and \\nfunctional even under high traffic. It should have basic “fail -safes” to ensure no votes are \\nlost if a user’s internet connection drops mid-session.'),\n",

Usability: \\nThe interface needs to be simple enough for anyone to use, regardless of their tech skills. \\nIt should be “fail -safe” and clear, ensuring that the process of voting is as intuitive as a \\nstandard physical ballot. \\n4.2. Feasibility Study \\nBefore starting the actual development, it is important to confirm that the project is realistic \\ngiven out current resources. This study evaluates whether technology exists to support our \\ngoals, if people will be able to use the system, and if the costs are manageable. \\n4.2.1. Technical Feasibility \\nThis part looks at whether the technology we’ve chosen is up to the task of running a secure \\nelection. Since we are using FastAPI for the backend, the system is technically solid \\nbecause it can handle many users at once without slowing down [3]. For the frontend, React \\nallows us to build a smooth, professional interface that works on both phones and \\ncomputers, making the system accessible to everyone. \\nThe security side is also highly feasible. We are using standard RSA encryption to keep \\nvotes private, which is a proven method in modern cybersecurity [1,5] . Additionally, the \\nuse of Sci kit-learn for anomaly detection means we can build a smart security layer that \\ncatches fraud automatically. All these tools are open-source and well-documented, so there \\nisn’t any major technical unknown that would stop us from finishing the project. \\n4.2.2. Operational Feasibility \\nThe system is designed to be very simple, so anyone who has ever used a basic app or \\nwebsite will know how to ca st their vote. We are making sure the flow of the system \\nmatches how people expect to vote, just in a digital format. \\nAdministrators will also find it easy to manage, as the system automates the hard part of \\ncounting and fraud checking. Studies show that when a system is easy to use clearly \\nsecurely, people are much more likely to trust it over old -school paper methods [4]. This \\nmakes the project highly feasible from a user-acceptance standpoint. \\n4.2.3. Economic Feasibility \\nSince this is a research -based project, the costs are very low. We are using open -source \\nsoftware and free development tools, so there is no need for expensive licenses. The main'),\n",

Path Length and Normalization: \\nFor a data point 𝑥 the Path Length is the number of edges 𝑥 traverses from the root to a leaf \\nnode. To make scores comparable across different sample sizes, we use the average path \\nlength of an unsuccessful search in a Binary Search Tree (BST), denoted as 𝑐(𝑛): \\n \\nwhere 𝐻(𝑖) is the harmonic number, estimated as  ln(𝑖) + 0.5772156649 (Euler’s \\nconstant). \\nC. Anomaly Score Calculation: \\n5. The anomaly score 𝑠(𝑥, 𝑛) for a point 𝑥 is calculated as: \\n \\n𝐸(ℎ(𝑥)) is the average path length of 𝑥 across all trees in the forest. \\nInterpretation: \\n• If 𝑠 → 1: The point is a definite anomaly (very short path). \\n• If  𝑠 < 0.5: The point is a normal instance. \\n• If 𝑠 ≈ 0.5: The entire sample does not have distinct anomalies. \\nD. Audit Benefit: \\nThe system automatically flags any vote or user session with a high “anomaly score”. This \\nallows administrators to review suspicious activities  such as multiple votes from a single \\nIP address without having to manually check thousands of logs. \\n6. Expected Outcome \\nThe expected outcome of this project is a functional and secure e-voting system prototype \\nthat ensures vote integrity, voter anonymity, and transparency. The system will provide real-\\ntime insights into election health and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning \\ntechniques in detecting electoral anomalies.'),\n",

Introduction \\nV oting is the backbone of any democracy, but the way we do it hasn’t changed  much in \\ndecades. We still mostly rely on paper ballots, which are slow to count, expensive to \\nmanage, and sometimes just hard to access for people who can’t easily get to a polling \\nstation. As everything else, from banking to education moves online, it’s natural that our \\nvoting system should too. \\nElectronic voting (e-voting) isn’t just about making things “faster”. It’s about making the \\nprocess more inclusive for everyone, including those in remote areas, people with \\ndisabilities, and people residing abroad. However, moving the ballot box to the internet \\ncomes with the huge problem: trust. If people can’t see their physical paper going in a box, \\nthey often worry about whether their vote was counted or if the system was hacked.  \\nOur project explores how we can build a digital voting system that people can trust.
